Snake Game using Turtle Graphics
This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python with the Turtle Graphics module. It recreates the nostalgic experience of playing Snake on old keypad phones while showcasing essential programming concepts.

Key Features:

Gameplay: Use the arrow keys to control the snake as it navigates the play area. Eat food to increase your score and grow longer.
Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body, displaying a "GAME OVER!" message.
Score Tracking: High scores are saved to a CSV file, allowing you to track your achievements between sessions.
Custom Elements: Leverages custom turtle classes (from the game_turtles module) to draw borders, display scores, and manage game objects.
Smooth Animation: The snake's movement is updated in a loop with controlled timing to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
